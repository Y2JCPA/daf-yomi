  <div class="point-item blue">Answer #2 (Rava): The lambs of the Omer and Tamid are Olos. If they are not brought like Chovos (like their original laws), they are Nedavos;</div>
  <div class="point-item green">R. Yochanan specifically taught Asham Metzora. If it is not brought like Chovah (with Nesachim), it cannot be a Nedavah.</div>

  <div class="point-item blue">Question: One intends to be Mekadesh only what he needs. Being Ne&#x27;ekar does not make things Kodesh!</div>
  <div class="point-item green">Answer #1 (Rav Dimi bar Shishna): This teaches that Klei Shares are Mekadesh without one&#x27;s intent.</div>
  <div class="point-item red">Answer #2 (Ravina): We can say that Klei Shares are not Mekadesh without intent. Chachamim decreed that Birutzim of wet measures are Kodesh, lest people think that we may use (for Chulin) things that were in a Kli Shares.</div>
  <div class="point-item purple">Question (R. Zeira - Mishnah): If Lechem ha&#x27;Panim was put on the Shulchan after Shabbos and the Bazichei Levonah were Huktar the following Shabbos, the bread is Pasul;</div>
  <div class="point-item orange">Rather, the bread must be left on the Shulchan from Shabbos to Shabbos (in this case, 13 days after it was put there. Only then we are Maktir the Levonah.) It is no problem to leave the bread on the Shulchan for many days.</div>
